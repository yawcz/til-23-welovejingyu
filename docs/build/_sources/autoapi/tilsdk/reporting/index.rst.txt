.. py:class:: RealPose


   Bases: :py:obj:`NamedTuple`

   Real coordinates (x, y, z) where z is angle from x-axis in deg.

   .. py:attribute:: x
      :type: float

      X-coordinate.

   .. py:attribute:: y
      :type: float

      Y-coordinate.

   .. py:attribute:: z
      :type: float

      Heading angle (rel. x-axis) in degrees.


.. py:class:: ReportingService(host = 'localhost', port = 5000)


   Communicates with reporting server to submit reports.

   :param host: Hostname or IP address of reporting server.
   :param port: Port number of reporting server.

   .. py:method:: check_pose(pose)

      Checks the status of the ``pose``.

      :returns: "Goal Reached" if pose is considered near enough to maze's end goal.
                "Task Checkpoint Reached" if pose is near enough to Task Checkpoint.
                "Not An Expected Checkpoint" if ``pose`` is not a goal, task or detour checkpoint.
                A RealPose of (x, y, heading in degrees) representing the next checkpoint if ``pose`` is a detour checkpoint.
      :rtype: str or RealPose


   .. py:method:: end_run()

      Tells the scoring server that the robot is terminating its run.
      Call this **only** after receiving confirmation from the scoring server that you
      have reached the maze goal.


   .. py:method:: report_audio(pose, answer, save_dir)

      Report answer for the Friend or Foe (Audio) task.

      :param pose: Robot's pose at the time when this corresponding checkpoint's task was being done.
      :type pose: RealPose
      :param answer: Answer for the Friend or Foe (Audio) task.
                     The expected format is <Filename of Audio File w/o file extension>_<Team Name>_<Member ID>
                     e.g. "audio1_My Team Name is Great_MemberA".
      :type answer: str
      :param save_dir: The directory for saving a returned folder of audio files into. The Reporting server
                       returns some audio files for the next task, "Decoding Digits".
      :type save_dir: str or Path

      :returns: **save_path** -- The path to the folder of contents retrieved from the server.
      :rtype: str


   .. py:method:: report_digit(pose, answer)

      Report answer for the Decoding Digits task.

      :param pose: Robot pose where targets were seen.
      :type pose: RealPose
      :param answer: A tuple of digits representing the digits decoded from a series of audio files.
      :type answer: Tuple

      :returns: **pose** -- Target pose of the next checkpoint.
      :rtype: RealPose


   .. py:method:: report_situation(img, pose, answer, save_dir)

      Report answer for the Friend or Foe (Visual) task, namely the situation about
      whether 'hostage' or 'suspect' is in the scene. This method will attempt to receive
      a zipped folder from the Reporting Server and unzip and save the folder into the
      ``save_dir``.

      :param img: cv2 image taken by robot and drawn with bounding boxes of detected objects.
      :type img: ndarray
      :param pose: Robot's pose at the time when this picture was taken.
      :type pose: RealPose
      :param answer: Who is in the scene: "hostage", "suspect" or "none".
      :type answer: str
      :param save_dir: The directory for saving the returned folder of audio files into.
                       The Reporting server returns some audio files for the next task,
                       "Friend or Foe (Audio)".
      :type save_dir: str or Path

      :returns: **save_path** -- The path to the folder of contents retrieved from the server.
      :rtype: str


   .. py:method:: start_run()

      Inform scoring server that the robot is starting the run.
      This **must** be called before making submissions to the scoring server and before the
      robot starts moving.


      :returns: **response** -- http response.
      :rtype: Flask.response



.. py:function:: save_zip(dir, response)

   save a zip file from a Flask Response into a local folder.

   :param start: Absolute path of directory for extracting a Flask response's zipped contents into.
   :type start: Path
   :param response:
   :type response: Flask Response that contains a zipped file.

   :returns: Path to folder of unzipped contents.
   :rtype: output_path


.. py:function:: save_zip(dir, response)

   save a zip file from a Flask Response into a local folder.

   :param start: Absolute path of directory for extracting a Flask response's zipped contents into.
   :type start: Path
   :param response:
   :type response: Flask Response that contains a zipped file.

   :returns: Path to folder of unzipped contents.
   :rtype: output_path


.. py:function:: validate_reid_submission(answer)

   Validate string submission for ReID Friend or Foe (Visual) task.

   The expected answer is "hostage", "suspect" or "none".


.. py:function:: validate_speakerid_submission(answer)

   Validate string submission for the Friend or Foe (Audio) task.
   The expected format is <Filename of Audio File w/o file extension>_<Team Name>_<Member ID>
   e.g. "audio1_My Team Name is Great_MemberA".
